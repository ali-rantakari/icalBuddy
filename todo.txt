user requests:
-------------------------

- Different properties on the same lines
	- could be implemented by:
		- making the leading newline part of the "indent" string so that it can be
		  omitted -> voila, items on the same line with custom separator
		- changing the indent argument to an "property separators" argument that can
		  be followed by a list of separators to use for printed properties (in the
		  same order as properties are printed) -- and if the number of specified
		  values is lower than the gaps between printed props, use the last given
		  value for all the rest of the gaps. this way users could specify different
		  separators for all the different "property gaps".
			- needs changes to the argument reading code: when iterating through
			  the arguments and we find this "property separators" argument,
			  read all the values after that until we come across the next
			  arg that begins with "-" (excluding "\-" so that the users could
			  specify a prop separator value that begins with a dash) and then
			  continue reading args from that index (...okay, maybe I won't
			  need to do this actually... should think this through. yeah,
			  I don't think this is needed)
- Output in CSV format (i.e. support for more than one (or even arbitrary) output format(s))
	- these two features above here will need similar architectural changes, i.e.
	  abstracting the methods for determining the output presentation and writing
	  multiple implementations
- Display also attachments
- Display also attendees


other (my own ideas):
-------------------------

- Make getEventPropStr() and getTaskPropStr() use NSMutableAttributedStrings from the beginning so that formatting could occur even within property names and values
	- Would this make the necessary string concatenation code too ugly? If so, how to deal with that? attrStrConcat() ?
- Rewrite man page using the POD syntax (I hate the raw man page syntax so much)
- Implement wrapping to a specified number of maximum characters on each line (problem: will look off with non-fixed-width fonts if we try to match indenting levels and fixing those problems with arguments might become really complex (i.e. you would need too many different kinds of arguments for all the different cases))

- Add timezone support (how to handle these?)


Replace versionNumberCompare() with this: (is this adequate? must test. might break with more than single-digit numbers.)

	NSNumberFormatter *conv = [[[NSNumberFormatter alloc] init] autorelease];
	NSNumber *curVersNum = [conv numberFromString:[versDict objectForKey:(id)@"Version"]];
	NSNumber *curVersBundleNum = [conv numberFromString:sb_bundleVers];
	
	if ([curVersBundleNum compare:curVersNum]==NSOrderedAscending)
		(-> update available)
